<h1>Join our Journey.</h1>
    <p>The AUDI AG stands for sporty vehicles, high build quality and progressive design - for “Vorsprung durch Technik.” The Audi Group is among the world’s leading producers of premium cars.
    To play an instrumental role in shaping the transformation as we head into a new age of mobility the Company is implementing its strategy step by step. Four interlocking rings symbolised 
    the merger of four automobile manufacturers based in the German state of Saxony: Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer became Auto Union AG. The company Wanderer originated as a bicycle repair shop. 
    Later on, they started building bicycles, then motorcycles. In 1913, the company produced its first small car, which was known as “Puppchen” — roughly translated as “moppet” in English.
    The fourth company was DKW, one of the largest motorcycle manufacturers of its time. The Danish founder, Jörgen Skafte Rasmussen, began experimenting with a steam-powered automobile 
    (Dampfkraftwagen - DKW) in 1916. His attempts were fruitless, however, and Rasmussen began developing two-stroke engines. A few years later, DKW was one of the most important motorcycle 
    manufacturers of the pre-war years. DKW started building automobiles in 1928. Due to the global recession in 1929, demand plummeted. The four car companies, who had been successful up until 
    that point, ran into financial difficulties. The solution was the union of the four brands, which was initiated by the state bank of Saxony. The Auto Union AG was born — the second-largest car
     manufacturer in Germany, according to the number of vehicles produced. And from Auto Union AG, the predecessor of today’s AUDI AG came into existence.</p>
